                One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market your property to
                the right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be able to identify who
                will be interested in your property and implement effective strategies to reach them via their website,
                paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with an agent who has partnered with
                Luxury Presence, you benefit from the many different types of marketing capabilities the company offers.
                Here is how:

            <h2 class="t2 textosub" id="link1">Paid Advertising on All Channels</h2>
            <p>To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they spend their time online, and
                how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are able to
                identify your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach
                those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted, ensuring
                you are not spending money marketing to those who are not in the market for a property such as yours.

                    <p class="parrafo1">Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote
                        your property. Being able to
                        create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the
                        agents who
                        use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors. According to a recent survey,
                        85 percent
                        of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses video—and for good reason. An agent
                        who uses video
                        is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport. When
                        they use video
                        to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would really be like to walk through
                        and live in
                        your home—something that is much more difficult to do with a written description.
                        However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be
                        described in
                        appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to
                        sell it. Those
                        agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters who
                        create blogs,
                        website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property attractive to potential
                        buyers

                    <h2 class="py-2 noche textosub"id="link3">Effective Search Engine Optimization</h2>
                    <p class="parrafo1">
                        Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they purchased on the internet. Many
                        of
                        them simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search
                        that
                        way. For your home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use
                        the
                        right terms in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as search
                        engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using the right terms is a
                        bit
                        of a science—one that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer
                        searches terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results and provide
                        opportunities for the buyer to learn more.

            <h2 class=" t2 textosub" id="link4">Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands of niche
                buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a
                large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate marketing
                service providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her time
                marketing your property and let an expert handle their social media presence? At Luxury Presence, our
                dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and become an
                authority in their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they can use
                their voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than their competitors. </p>

                            <p>Every real estate agent’s success starts with their website. If an agent doesn’t have a

                                experience for viewers who want to look at properties, they’ve already lost their

                                Those agents who work with Luxury Presence have websites that are designed and managed

                                to help them easily utilize their site and maximize its potential. An agent who is

                                a powerful website is one who can easily reach a niche audience, streamline the selling
